Use the “1958 He Scale of Temperatures”, or the [online calculator from Quantum Design](https://qdusa.com/support/helium_vapor_pressure.html), or create a function from the official polynomial fit described in the [International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90)](https://courses.washington.edu/phys431/superconductivity/ITS-1990_McGlashan_JChemThermo_1990.pdf), to convert the pressure readings to temperature $T$ (K).\n",

From both ways of fitting, find the critical temperature at zero field $T_c$ and the critical field at 0K $H_{c0}$.\n",
